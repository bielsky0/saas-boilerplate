/**
 * Booking — one athlete's place in one session (langlion §1.2, §5.2, §5.3).
 *
 * ⚠️ COLUMNS PROTECTED BY AN OBJECT DRIZZLE CANNOT SEE. `athleteId`,
 * `sessionStartTime`, `sessionEndTime` and `paymentStatus` participate in the
 * `booking_athlete_no_overlap_excl` EXCLUDE constraint, hand-written in the
 * migration. See the equivalent note in `sessions.ts` for the three consequences;
 * the short version is that `drizzle-kit push` would drop it and is banned.
 *
 * `sessionId` points at `class_session`, not at the auth `session` table — see
 * that module's header for why the langlion entity carries the `class_` prefix.
 *
 * WHY THE TIMES ARE DENORMALISED. An exclusion constraint can only read columns
 * of its own table, so "this athlete is not double-booked across overlapping
 * sessions" (§5.3) requires the session's time span to live here too. The obvious
 * risk is drift, and the usual mitigation is a rule ("update both in one
 * transaction") that every future edit path has to remember — §2.2, §3.4/AC3 and
 * the mass-move flows all touch session times.
 *
 * So it is not a rule here (decyzja D4). The composite foreign key below points
 * at `session (id, organizationId, startTime, endTime)` with ON UPDATE CASCADE:
 * moving a session rewrites its bookings' copies as part of the same statement,
 * and a move that would put an athlete in two places at once fails on the
 * exclusion constraint rather than corrupting the copy. US-3.4/AC7's "skip that
 * one session, carry on with the rest" then falls out of per-session
 * transactions instead of needing detection logic.
 *
 * `payment_status` union (validated in `features/bookings/schema.ts`):
 *   "payment_pending" | "booked_offline" | "confirmed" | "cancelled" | "no_show"
 * Everything except "cancelled" counts as occupying a seat (§2.3) — including
 * "payment_pending", which is what lets an approved group-change request hold a
 * place while the parent pays (US-11.3/AC2).
